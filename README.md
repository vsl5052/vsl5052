**Vedant Lanjewar - Data Science Portfolio** 

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Here, I showcase a selection of projects that highlight my expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and visualization. These projects involve real-world data from Kaggle competitions, academic research, and personal initiatives. Feel free to explore the code, read through the analysis, and reach out if you have any questions!
